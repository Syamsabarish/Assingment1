The Local Food Wastage Management System is a user-friendly web app built with Streamlit and SQLite, designed to minimize food wastage by connecting providers (restaurants, supermarkets, grocery stores, etc.) with receivers (NGOs, charities, individuals). The platform facilitates efficient management, donation, and tracking of surplus food.
